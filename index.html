        <h1>Why LMB</h1>
        <p>
            The school has a very wide spectrum of co-curricular activities which receive as much importance as the academic disciplines. Through this extensive range of activities, the students are exposed to varying situations and issues. They regularly participate in Inter-School Competitions at the local, State, National and occasionally, at the International level. The scholastic, the intra and the extra-mural programmes of La Martiniere are geared to nurturing academic excellence, independent and creative thought, tapping of diverse talents, leadership training and a deep commitment to serving the community. 
            La Martiniere for Boys, Kolkata offers an all-round education up to the Higher Secondary level. It is affiliated to the Council for the ISC Examinations New Delhi, which conducts the ICSE & ISC Examinations at the close of Classes 10 and 12.
            Established in 1836, La Martiniere for Boys has been imparting academic excellence as well as ensuring holistic development so that every pupil passing through its portals faces the outside world with integrity and sound character. Owing to strong academics, varied extra and co-curricular activities, and the exemplary performance of our boys, both inside and outside school, we treasure the reputation of being rated as one of the best schools in India.

We are a school based on strong Christian values, but secular in our instructions. We start with boys at two and a half years, which really puts them at the centre of all that the school is about, and gradually build their connection with the school in a compassionate and healthy environment. This develops a passion for learning and they enjoy each day in school. After class 12, their journey in school comes to an end, when they pass out as thorough gentlemen, each one ready to make a valuable contribution to the world.

        <p>

            Our pupils give us plenty of reasons to be proud of. This is achieved under the close guidance of learned, caring and deeply committed staff, who help me in providing new challenges, opportunities and balanced education for our pupils.

            A successful school cannot function in isolation. My endeavour has always been to strengthen the tri-polar bonding – between the school, the pupils and the parents, so that we can share in the collaborative effort to bring about spiritual nurturing and effective and successful learning. A kind of education that can change our boys and through them will make the world a better place. It is a source of satisfaction to see that our pupils are prepared not just to earn a living, but have also learnt how to live. 
            In 1752, a 17 year old Frenchman named Claude Martin came to India as a humble private in the armies of the East India Company. But Claude Martin was no ordinary soldier of fortune. He rose rapidly to the rank of Major General and also spent many years in the service of Shuja-ud-daulah, the Nawab of Oudh. By the time of his death in September 1800, he had amassed property worth over half a million pounds sterling. So far, Claude Martin’s career reads like that of so many other Europeans who found fame and fortune under the powerful patronage of the East India Company. And indeed, if that was all there was to the man, he would have soon been forgotten in the musty pages of history. However, Claude Martin was a man of vision and he left generous endowments to start schools in Lucknow, Kolkata and in Lyon, in his native land of France. La Martiniere Schools, Kolkata, were the result of his desire to start an educational institution for the ‘’public good of the town of Calcutta’’. It took 30 years to dispose of the litigation arising out of Claude Martin’s will. Finally, as a result of a Supreme Court decision, La Martiniere Schools opened in Kolkata, on 1st March, 1836.
